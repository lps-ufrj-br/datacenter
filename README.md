### Recreate the cluster

```
play cluster create -n cpu-large
```

### Reboot all physical nodels

```
play cluster reboot -n cpu-large
```

### Restore a node into the cluster:

```
play vm create -n caloba51
```

### Destroy a node into the cluster:

```
play vm destroy -n caloba51
```

### Install a package into a nodes:

```
play vm run -c "sudo apt install -y new_package && source /mnt/market_place/scripts/install_root.sh" -n caloba[51-54]
```

### Update singularity fake roots:

```
play vm run -c "python /mnt/market_place/scripts/datacenter/data/scripts/configure_singularity.py" -n caloba[51-54]
```
